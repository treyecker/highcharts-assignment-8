    <p>The data above is from <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-1">Table 1: Crime in the United States by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 2000â€“2019</a> of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting progam</p>

    <p>
      The data in the table above examines violent crime across America from 2014 to 2019, and it normalizes this data by examining a rate. The numbers calculated for the total violent crime rate were determined by totaling the offenses of murder, rape (revised definition), robbery, and aggravated assault. Examining this data is important it provides a measure of crime trends throughout the country over multiple years. The deeper dive into the specific types of violent crime also provides a perspective into which crimes are increasing or decreasing. For example, in this data ser we can see that aggravated assualt rose over the years, reaching its peak in 2019. Additionally, violence observed in communities can have impacts on children witnessing or being exposed to these acts. According to <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-1">the office of disease prevention and health promotion</a>, the effects of violence on youth can result in a greater risk for substance use, risky sexual behavior, and unsafe driving behavior in adulthood.

    <p>The data above is from <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/violent-crime">Table 5: Crime in the United States by State, 2019</a> of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting progam</p>

    <p>Examining violent crime rates across the country is one thing, but it can paint a picture that crime is going up in your area when it's not. Thus, measuring crime rates from a more localized perspective, such as state by state can offer helpful paramters for citizens to view. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/">Pew research</a>, Americans generally think crime is up nationally but not locally. So, looking at violent crime on a state scale allows citizens to determine whether crime is actually increasing in their area. The data in the table above examines violent crime rates by state in 2019. These rates were determined by totaling the offenses of murder, rape (revised definition), robbery, and aggravated assault. </p>
